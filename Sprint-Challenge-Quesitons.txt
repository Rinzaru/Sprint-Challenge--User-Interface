1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is what we use to give meaning to a webpage such as assigning the <p> element to a paragraph so that when we are
working on the webpage we know what exactly it is we are editing. We would also assign classes and ID's to further 
enhance our ability to edit the page being able to pick and choose specific parts of the page or multiple parts (classes)
to edit all at once.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. 
A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, 
except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).

display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. 
Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that however has the smallest possible width.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

git is valuable for a team of developers because it allows everyone to work on the code away from its master branch. 
This means each developer can add new features or remove features without inturpting someone else's work. after the work is done
it can be pushed into the master branch for everyone in that team to be able to see and use.
